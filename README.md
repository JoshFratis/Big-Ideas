## Installation Instructions
Simply download the files - it all is self contained and requires no dependencies or additional setup. 

## Usage Instructions
Assuming you have python installed, `cd` to the directory of the file. From there, just type the filename, `program.ipynb`, and execution should begin immediately.

## Contribution Instructions
Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! Again, like with the installation, there no additional dependencies required to build and execute the program. As such, if you have a contribution to make, please open a pull request and one of our contributors will review it shortly. Thanks again for your time!
